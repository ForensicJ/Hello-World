# Hello-World

Hello everyone my name is Jay 

I'm really interested in beginning to pursue my career in computer Forensics! 🤪

I am looking to meet like-minded people that cannot only be my friends but also my teachers 👨‍🏫 

I'm very passionate and I come into this industry with passion & drive 🧐 

I do not have no qualifications I have not gone to college nor university this is all fuelled by Passion 💯 

I've gone out and bought a setup which consists of a laptop Wi-Fi adaptors and the program Kali linux I'm also looking for any forensic operating systems or softwares that can really help me in bringing my dream and vision into reality so if you have any suggestions please suggest operating systems that can help me achieve this 📝 

I am looking for mentors teachers & friends that won't just only help me but will also be there in my future if you are a know-it-all and arrogant please stay away what I'm looking for is a know-it-all who has great leadership and teaching abilities if this is you please reach out 🤲 

I am very passionate about the subjects both Penetration Testing & Computer Forensics that I have gone out and have spent money on books if you have any suggestions please feel free to suggest I've begun to read not only about Penetration Testing but I've also bought books regarding computer Forensics 🔬🚨🕵️‍♂️

For the last several weeks I've been playing around with Kali and it's almost becoming an addiction 🙄😩🤧 

So once again I really asked please reach out I'm not shy I will be following everyone reaching out to everyone reading as many conversations as I can read but please I asked for serious help in pursuing my passion and my future 🙏

Thank You!!! 🥂
